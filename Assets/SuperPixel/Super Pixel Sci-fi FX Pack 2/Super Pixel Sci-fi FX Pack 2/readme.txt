// HOW TO USE THIS ASSET PACK //
////////////////////////////////

Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders named PNG and spritesheet.

- The PNG folder contains all the effect animations separated into their own folders, with the frames as individual PNG files.

- The spritesheet folder contains all the effect animations separated into their own folders, but with the frames packed into a single image. A metadata file is alongside each spritesheet which may be used to parse the image.

- Recommended animation FPS: 15 (66.7 ms/frame)

- The black hole and scan effects have multiple animations: Appear, loop, and disappear. The animations seamlessly transition into one another from their last frames.

- The tech aura effect has versions which are split into the effect's front half and back half. By drawing them separately at the same position in-game, you can sandwich a character between them and have it appear to be "inside" the effect.
