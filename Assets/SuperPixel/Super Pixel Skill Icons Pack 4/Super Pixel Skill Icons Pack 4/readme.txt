Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

Hello! Thank you for downloading the Super Pixel Skill Icons Pack 4 asset pack. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and understand this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders corresponding to the various pieces of the asset pack. The skill icons are in the icons folder.

- The autocast, cooldown, and highlight animations are designed to be overlaid on the icons.

- The cooldown animation is provided at full opacity, so you can customize how transparent/opaque it is in your game.

- To display the correct frame of the cooldown animation:
	1. Assume the ability has two variables: cooldown_current and cooldown_max, where:
		* cooldown_max represents the maximum cooldown value. (e.g. if your ability goes on cooldown for 10 seconds, then cooldown_max = 10)
		* cooldown_current represents a timer that goes down linearly with time. (e.g. when you use the ability, cooldown_current gets set to cooldown_max and then decreases at a rate of 1 per second in your game loop)
	2. The cooldown animation is 100 frames, to make it easy to convert percentage to frame. We can get a percentage with this formula:
		* percent = (1.0f - cooldown_current / cooldown_max)
		  (The percentage is inverted, because the animation starts at full cooldown)
	3. With the percentage, multiply by the length of the animation (100 frames).
		* frame = round(percent * 100.0f)
	4. Display the frame of the animation indicated by the calculation- All done!

	Example:
		Ability has cooldown of 10 seconds, and 3 seconds have elapsed since it was used.
		cooldown_max = 10.0
		cooldown_current = 7.0
		percent = (1.0f - cooldown_current / cooldown_max) // value: 0.3
		frame = round(percent * 100.0f) // value: 30
		// Display frame 30

- Recommended animation FPS: 30 (50 ms/frame)
