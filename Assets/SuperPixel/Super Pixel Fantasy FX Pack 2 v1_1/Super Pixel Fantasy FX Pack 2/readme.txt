// HOW TO USE THIS ASSET PACK //
////////////////////////////////

Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders named PNG and spritesheet.

- The PNG folder contains all the effect animations separated into their own folders, with the frames as individual PNG files.

- The spritesheet folder contains all the effect animations separated into their own folders, but with the frames packed into a single image. A metadata file is alongside each spritesheet which may be used to parse the image.

- Recommended animation FPS: 15 (66.7 ms/frame)

- The lightning spell effect is a little special. It has start, loop, and end animations. This allows you to make lightning strikes of any duration. It also has versions of those animations marked "tileable." This means it can be looped vertically, so you can make lightning strikes of any height.

- (New: Version 1.1) The cure effect has versions which are split into the effect's front half and back half. By drawing them separately at the same position in-game, you can sandwich a character between them and have it appear to be "inside" the effect.
